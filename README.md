## Project Overview
HackTUI is an Elixir-native Security Operations Center (SOC) dashboard. It provides real-time visibility into system-level events and network traffic by leveraging the BEAM's concurrency model to stream data from low-level system tools into a centralized terminal interface.

## Core Features
- Real-time DNS Monitoring: Captures outbound DNS queries using tcpdump to identify potential data exfiltration or beaconing to suspicious TLDs.
- System Journal Streaming: Integrates directly with journalctl to provide a live feed of authentication attempts, sudo usage, and kernel events.
- Automated Threat Detection: Heuristic-based alerting system that flags suspicious network destinations and system permission failures in real-time.
- Reactive UI Architecture: Built on ExRatatui, featuring a multi-pane layout with color-coded severity levels for rapid incident response.

## Architecture
The system operates as a supervised tree of specialized GenServers:
- NetScout: Manages a Port-based interface to tcpdump for network packet inspection.
- LogSentinel: Streams systemd journal entries into the application state.
- State: A centralized GenServer acting as the single source of truth for the UI.
- Dashboard: The rendering engine that transforms application state into the terminal layout.

## Installation and Setup
### System Dependencies
The monitoring agents require specific Linux capabilities to run without root privileges:
```bash
# Grant network sniffing permissions
sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip' $(which tcpdump)

# Grant journal access
sudo usermod -a -G systemd-journal $USER

## Application Setup
```bash
# Clone and compile
git clone [https://github.com/HackTuah/HackTUI.git](https://github.com/HackTuah/HackTUI.git)
cd HackTUI
mix compile

## Usage
Run the dashboard:
```bash
mix run --no-halt
